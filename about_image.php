You can add an image to your profile. If you have space on a webserver
somewhere, upload your image, then type the URL of the image in the
avatar text box to the right. The image will be at the discresion of the
board admins. If it's too big or inappropiate, it may be deleted. Please
try to keep your file size below 20kb, so as not to slow down the board.
